Telegram Crypto Chat Analysis Bot Architecture

Introduction

Note: this file has been split into structured docs under `docs/`. Start at `docs/README.md`.

This document outlines the architecture for a Telegram bot designed to analyze messages in cryptocurrency-focused chat groups using a user account (userbot) rather than a standard bot account. The bot monitors specified crypto chats that the user is a member of, analyzes the content and context of messages in real-time, and delivers categorized alerts to the user in a private Telegram chat. Key features of the system include:
	•	Alerting with Threads: The bot sends alerts to a private Telegram chat (or channel/group) organized by threads (topics) corresponding to categories such as “Urgent”, “Potentially Interesting”, “Overview”, etc., for easy navigation.
	•	Message Analysis Pipeline: Incoming messages are analyzed for various signals: spikes in chat activity, mentions of cryptocurrency tokens, posts by verified callers (trusted signalers), and an AI-based semantic importance score indicating how critical the message content is.
	•	Multi-Chain Token Support: The bot recognizes tokens on Base and Ethereum networks, with options to filter or focus on specific chains. It can fetch token metadata and safety information via external APIs (e.g. price, market cap, fully diluted value, contract verification, honeypot checks).
	•	Reputation and Filtering: Maintains a rating system for both “callers” (influential users in chats) and the chats themselves, using configurable formulas. This helps prioritize alerts from reputable sources and high-quality chats.
	•	User Commands: Supports admin commands (e.g. /spikesedit, /callers 30) to adjust settings or query information (like editing spike detection parameters or listing top callers in the last 30 days).
	•	AI-Assisted Post-Processing: Implements a delayed AI analysis mechanism: every 4–6 hours, the bot compiles a batch of borderline or complex messages and uses an AI service to re-analyze or summarize them, refining the classification (e.g. generating an “Overview” summary or reclassifying missed important messages).
	•	Data Storage and Logging: All relevant data (messages, events, ratings, user configurations) are stored in a structured database. A robust logging mechanism tracks the bot’s operations and important events for debugging and auditing.
	•	Extensibility: The architecture is designed with future expansion in mind, allowing multiple users (multi-tenancy) and subscription-based access with isolated configurations per user.

High-Level Architecture

High-level architecture of the crypto chat analysis bot. The bot (running via a user account) listens to designated Telegram crypto chats, processes each new message through various analysis components (spike detection, token mention parsing, caller identification, AI scoring), and generates categorized alerts. It integrates with external crypto data APIs for token information and uses an AI service for deeper analysis on a schedule. Results are stored in a database and delivered to the user through a private Telegram channel with threads for categories. Logging and monitoring components track the bot’s activity.

At a high level, the system consists of the following parts:
	•	Telegram Client (User Account): The bot runs using the Telegram API with the user’s credentials (API ID/hash and user auth token). This allows it to join and read messages from private groups as a real user. It listens for new messages in target crypto chats and also listens for any user-issued commands in the private control chat.
	•	Processing Core: An asynchronous message processing pipeline that handles incoming messages. This core includes sub-components for detecting spikes in activity, extracting token mentions, identifying messages from trusted callers, and scoring message importance (including using AI for NLP-based analysis). Based on these analyses, the core classifies messages into categories (Urgent, Interesting, etc.) or disregards them if not significant.
	•	Alert Delivery Module: Takes important classified messages and forwards or summarizes them into the private output chat. Within this chat (which could be a Telegram “forum” group or channel with topics), alerts are posted into the appropriate thread corresponding to their category. For example, a critical alert goes to the “Urgent” thread. Less critical but noteworthy items go to “Possibly Interesting”, and periodic summaries or batched info go to an “Overview” thread.
	•	External Integrations: Modules to query external services for additional data: e.g. calling a crypto data API (such as CoinGecko or others) to fetch token price, market cap, and supply info , or using a honeypot detection API (such as Honeypot.is) to simulate trades on a token’s contract to detect scams  . These integrations enrich the bot’s analysis and alerts with up-to-date token information and safety warnings.
	•	Data Storage (Database): A database (SQL or NoSQL) for persisting information: chat messages and analysis results, detected events (spikes, etc.), token data, caller and chat reputations, and user configuration/preferences. This storage allows the bot to maintain state, perform historical analysis (e.g. message rates over time), and recover from restarts without losing context.
	•	Scheduler & AI Module: A scheduling system (could be a simple cron-like thread or an async job queue) triggers periodic tasks, notably the AI delayed analysis. In these tasks, the bot compiles a set of recent messages flagged as “ambiguous” or needing deeper insight, and sends them to an AI service (e.g. an LLM or classification model) for further analysis or summarization. The AI’s output may produce a summary of events for the “Overview” thread or recategorize certain items. The scheduler can also handle other periodic tasks like refreshing token data or pruning old records.
	•	Command Handler: A component that parses and executes administrative commands issued by the user (or authorized users) via Telegram messages. This allows dynamic reconfiguration (adjust thresholds, update lists, query statistics) without stopping the bot.
	•	Logging & Monitoring: All key actions and errors are logged to a file or console with timestamps and context. This includes message events received, decisions made by the analysis pipeline, API calls, warnings or errors (e.g. API failures), and user command usage. Logging helps in debugging and maintaining transparency of the bot’s operation. In a production setting, monitoring dashboards or alerts could be set up (e.g. track if the bot disconnects or if certain error rates spike).

The following sections describe each component and the overall workflow in more detail, with example configurations and pseudocode for clarity.

Telegram Integration (User Account Bot)

To access messages in private groups and chats, the bot uses a user account session via the Telegram API (for example, using the Python Telethon or Pyrogram library). This approach logs in with the user’s phone number and a Telegram API ID/hash, acting as a real user. It enables the bot to join and monitor groups that might not allow regular bot accounts.

Connection Setup: The bot developer must obtain a Telegram API ID and API hash (from my.telegram.org) and create a session (which generates an authorization token after login). The session can be saved to avoid re-login on each run. For example, using Telethon:

from telethon import TelegramClient, events

# Telegram API credentials (replace with actual api_id, api_hash, and session name)
api_id = 123456
api_hash = 'abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890'
session_name = 'crypto_userbot'

# Initialize Telegram client for user account
client = TelegramClient(session_name, api_id, api_hash)

# Start the client (assumes prior authorization)
await client.start()  # or client.start(phone="+123456789", password="...") on first run
print("Userbot connected as:", await client.get_me())

In this snippet, we set up a Telegram client that will connect as the user. The events module from Telethon will be used to subscribe to new message events.

Monitoring Target Chats: The user (and thus the userbot) should already be a member of the relevant crypto group chats that need monitoring. We can specify a list of target chat IDs or usernames to listen to. For example:

# Define which chats to monitor (by ID or username). Could be group names or IDs.
target_chats = [ -1001234567890, "ExampleCryptoChat1", "ExampleCryptoChat2" ]

# Event handler for new messages in those chats
@client.on(events.NewMessage(chats=target_chats))
async def handle_new_message(event):
    msg = event.message.message  # text content of the message
    chat_id = event.chat_id      # ID of the chat where the message came
    sender_id = event.sender_id  # user ID of the sender
    # Process the message (analysis pipeline)
    await process_message(chat_id, sender_id, msg, event.message)

The handler handle_new_message will be triggered for every new message in the specified chats. We then call process_message (an async function we would define) to analyze the message. By using an asynchronous library, the bot can handle many messages concurrently if needed.

Notes on Telegram API usage:
	•	Using a user account session means the bot must abide by Telegram’s client limitations (e.g., rate limits, flood limits). It should take care not to spam or it could get the account restricted. For example, sending too many messages (alerts) in a short time or calling too many API requests can trigger Telegram’s anti-spam measures. The implementation should include delays or batching for outputs and external calls when necessary.
	•	The bot’s presence in chats is as a normal user. It may be prudent to run this on an account that is not the user’s main personal account (to avoid bans on a personal account if something goes wrong). A dedicated “userbot” account could be used.
	•	Privacy: Because this approach has full access to the user account, safeguarding the API credentials and session file is critical. If multi-user support is added in future, each user’s credentials must be stored securely (encrypted) on the server.

Message Analysis Pipeline

When a new message is received, the bot’s core logic analyzes it through several steps. The goal is to decide if the message is relevant enough to alert the user and, if so, under what category. The analysis pipeline can be structured as follows:
	1.	Pre-processing: Normalize the message text (trim, handle case, remove irrelevant formatting) and gather basic metadata (timestamp, sender, chat). The system might ignore messages from the user themselves or specific bot accounts if those are present in chats, to reduce noise.
	2.	Spike Detection: Check if the chat is currently experiencing an activity spike. A spike is defined as an unusually high message rate in the chat, which could indicate a lot of excitement or news breaking. The bot maintains a short-term message count for each chat (e.g., messages per minute). For example, if a chat usually averages 1 message/min and suddenly gets 20 messages in a minute, that’s a significant spike. If a message arrives during such a spike and is within the first few messages of that spike, it might be flagged as potentially important context.
	•	Implementation: The bot can keep an in-memory sliding window or use the database to count messages per interval. If count(last 5 min) > threshold, set a flag spike=True for messages in that window. The threshold could be dynamic (e.g., 3× the average rate) or a static number (configurable per chat or globally).
	•	Alert logic: The first message(s) that triggered the spike could be tagged as “urgent” (especially if they also mention tokens or come from notable users), because they might contain the info causing the discussion burst. Alternatively, the bot might issue a separate alert like “Spike detected in ChatX: 50 messages/5min (normal 5/min)” in an Overview thread, with context of what topic is being discussed (possibly via AI summarization of those messages).
	3.	Token Mention Extraction: Scan the message for any token identifiers. This includes token ticker symbols (e.g., “BTC”, “ETH”, or newer tokens like “PEPE”), token names, and especially contract addresses (Ethereum or Base addresses which are typically 0x… hex strings). If a contract address is found, the bot can attempt to identify the token (via an API or a local list of known tokens) and note which blockchain it belongs to (Ethereum vs Base, etc.).
	•	The bot should have configuration for which tokens or networks to focus on. For example, it might ignore mentions of top coins like BTC/ETH if the interest is in newly launched tokens, or vice versa. It could maintain allow-lists or block-lists for token symbols.
	•	If a token of interest is found, the bot will fetch fresh data for it (price, market capitalization, FDV, liquidity, etc.) via an external API (see Token Data Integration section below). This data can be included in the alert, e.g. “Token XYZ ($XYZ) mentioned – Price $0.05, MCAP $10M, FDV $50M.”
	•	Additionally, if a contract address is mentioned, the bot can automatically run a honeypot check using an API. For instance, it could call an API like Honeypot.is to simulate a buy/sell on Ethereum or Base to detect if the contract is likely a honeypot scam  . The result (honeypot or not) can be noted in the alert for safety.
	4.	Verified Caller Check: Determine if the sender of the message is a known “caller” – someone whose messages are considered signals or calls (for example, users known for calling out new tokens or pumps). The bot should maintain a list/database of such verified callers with their user IDs or usernames and perhaps a rating for each (based on past performance or trust level).
	•	If the sender is a verified caller, the message gains significance. For instance, a message from a top-rated caller that mentions a token or a buy signal would likely be “Urgent” or at least “Interesting”. The pipeline would flag caller=True and maybe retrieve the caller’s current rating or reliability score to include in analysis (e.g., “CallerAlice (rating 8.5/10) posted: …”).
	•	If the message is forwarded from another chat or channel (which sometimes happens when callers forward announcements), the bot might check the original sender or channel against the verified list as well.
	5.	Content Analysis & AI Scoring: Evaluate the semantic content of the message for importance. This can be a simple keyword-based approach combined with an AI NLP model for deeper understanding:
	•	Keyword/Phrase Checks: Look for certain trigger phrases like “launching now”, “rug pull”, “scam”, “ATH”, “listing”, or question marks indicating uncertainty, etc. These can give a quick heuristic score. For example, mention of “listing on Binance” or “contract is live” might be urgent, whereas generic chat might not.
	•	AI Semantic Analysis: Utilize an AI model (could be a cloud API like OpenAI GPT, or a local model) to assess the message in context. This might involve asking the model questions such as “Is this message announcing something important about a token?” or “Does this message sound like a trading signal or just chatter?”. The model could output a score or category.
	•	Since calling an AI model for every single message might be too slow or costly, this step can be optimized. One approach is to do a lightweight check first (keywords & simple heuristics). Only if those heuristics indicate a message is borderline (not obviously trivial or obviously important) do we then call the AI for a more nuanced judgment. Alternatively, a smaller local ML model could first be used as a filter.
	6.	Importance Scoring & Categorization: Combine the signals from the above steps to compute an overall importance score or category for the message. For example, the bot could calculate a numeric score with contributions from:
	•	Spike context (if spike=True, add X points),
	•	Token mention (add points based on token novelty or value, maybe more points if market cap is low implying a potential gem or if honeypot check is clean),
	•	Verified caller (add points proportional to caller’s rating),
	•	AI content score (e.g., if AI says this is very important, set a high base score),
	•	Keyword hits (some keywords add or subtract points).
The formula for scoring and the thresholds for categories can be defined in the configuration. For example:
	•	Score > 0.9 ⇒ “Urgent” category (immediate alert, likely a strong trading signal or major news).
	•	Score between 0.5 and 0.9 ⇒ “Potentially Interesting” category (alert, but lower priority).
	•	Score < 0.5 but message still somewhat noteworthy (e.g., part of a spike but content not clearly important) ⇒ queue for later analysis (could go into an “Overview” summary instead of immediate alert).
	•	Score extremely low or irrelevant ⇒ ignore (no alert).
The bot can implement this as a simple if/else or a more complex multi-criteria decision. Using a weighted score makes it easy to adjust sensitivity by tuning weights in config.
	7.	Alert Preparation: If the message is to be alerted (Urgent or Interesting), format the alert content. This typically includes:
	•	The source chat name and possibly a link to the message (Telegram deep link) if the user wants to read full context.
	•	The content of the message (possibly trimmed if very long, or just key lines).
	•	Metadata like time, sender (and caller rating if applicable).
	•	Any token info fetched (price, market cap, etc.) and warnings (like “⚠️ honeypot suspected” or “✅ contract verified, not a honeypot”).
	•	Perhaps an initial AI-generated note if AI provided a brief classification (e.g., “AI: This sounds like a new token launch announcement”).
The alert text should be concise but informative, since it will be posted in the alert chat. If it’s urgent, maybe use an emoji or prefix to denote that.
	8.	Output Dispatch: The finalized alert is then sent to the private alert chat in the appropriate thread (topic) for its category. This is done by using Telegram API to send a message. Since we want threads by category, the bot needs the topic IDs for “Urgent”, “Interesting”, “Overview”, etc. These topics can be set up manually in the output chat (which could be a Telegram forum group, where multiple topics are allowed). The bot can store the mapping of category name to topic ID (or the message ID of the topic’s first message). Then it uses the reply_to parameter in send_message to post in that thread. For example, using Telethon:

# Pseudocode: send alert to specific thread by reply_to (topic ID)
topic_id = category_topics["Urgent"]  # e.g., category_topics = {"Urgent": 6, ...}
await client.send_message(output_chat_id, alert_text, reply_to=topic_id)

Here, output_chat_id is the ID of the private alert chat (or channel), and reply_to=topic_id ensures the message appears in the thread whose ID equals topic_id  . If Telegram’s API changes or if using a different library, the implementation might differ slightly, but conceptually this is how to target a thread.

	9.	Recording the Event: Finally, log the event (for debugging/audit) and store the message and its analysis outcome in the database. Storing allows the system to avoid re-alerting on the same message and to use the data for future analysis (like calculating caller success or chat activity patterns). For example, after processing:

await db.insert_message(chat_id, message_id=event.message.id, sender_id=sender_id,
                        text=msg, timestamp=event.message.date,
                        category=assigned_category, importance=score, tokens=tokens_found,
                        caller_flag=caller_flag)

The above is pseudocode indicating that we save details of the message and what category we assigned. Similarly, if a spike was detected or an alert was sent, we might insert a record into an events table for spikes or alerts.

Throughout this pipeline, if any step determines the message is definitely not of interest (e.g., no tokens, no keywords, not from a caller, and no spike), the pipeline can short-circuit and drop the message (perhaps just increment a counter or store minimal info and not alert). This ensures the user only gets relevant alerts.

External Token Data Integration

Cryptocurrency data changes rapidly, and having context like price or market cap can help the user decide how to act on an alert. The bot integrates with external APIs to fetch token-related data when a token is mentioned. The integration includes:
	•	Market Data API: When a token symbol or contract is detected, the bot queries an API (for example, the CoinGecko API) to get current data on that token. CoinGecko’s /coins/markets endpoint can provide price, 24h change, market capitalization, circulating supply and other info given a token identifier . The bot might maintain a mapping of token symbols or contract addresses to CoinGecko IDs or use a search endpoint to find the token. Data like market cap and FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation) can indicate the scale of the project (FDV is essentially market cap if the max supply were in circulation; the bot can compute this if total supply is known).
	•	On-chain Data and Honeypot Checks: For new or obscure tokens (often the case in crypto signal chats), on-chain data is critical. The bot can use services like:
	•	Honeypot Detection APIs: e.g., Honeypot.is, which supports Ethereum and Base networks . This service attempts actual transactions to see if selling is restricted. If a token is a honeypot (you can buy but not sell), the bot will mark it clearly (this is an urgent warning for the user not to buy that token). For implementation, the bot would call an HTTP API endpoint with the token’s contract address and parse the result (e.g., a boolean or a status message).
	•	Contract Verification and Safety: The bot can check if a contract is verified on Etherscan (via Etherscan’s API) or use a service like GoPlus or DeFi safety APIs to get a security assessment of the contract. For example, detect if the contract has functions that could be used for rug pulls, or if liquidity is locked. These checks could be slower, so perhaps only done for tokens that scored as important (to include in the alert or a follow-up message).
	•	Real-time Price and Liquidity: If available, the bot might query DEX APIs (like Uniswap subgraph or Dexscreener API) for newly launched tokens to get price and liquidity pool info (how much liquidity, etc.). This can help gauge if a token is likely to pump or if it’s too small.
	•	Caching and Updates: The bot should cache results for tokens for a short period (say, a few minutes) to avoid flooding APIs if the same token is mentioned repeatedly. However, since crypto prices move, it might refresh price data if an alert is being sent more than e.g. 1 minute after last fetch. A strategy is:
	•	Maintain an in-memory dict of token -> (last_fetch_time, data).
	•	If a token data is older than a threshold or if a certain event triggers (like a huge price movement since last fetch, if we are tracking it), then fetch fresh data.
	•	Also, a periodic task (maybe every 10-15 minutes) could update data for tokens that have ongoing interest (for example, tokens mentioned in the last hour) so that any follow-up alerts or summaries have up-to-date info.
	•	Error Handling: API calls can fail or be slow. The bot should handle exceptions from HTTP requests gracefully, possibly retrying once or falling back to a secondary API. In an alert, if price info is unavailable, it can either skip that part or say “Price: N/A”. Logging should capture API errors for later troubleshooting. Possibly, rate limits from these APIs might require the developer to use API keys or backoff strategies.

By integrating these data sources, the alerts the bot sends become much more useful than just raw message forwards – they provide context (e.g., “Token ABC mentioned by caller Bob – current price $0.02, marketcap $5M, honeypot ✅ not detected, contract verified.”). This saves the user time in checking these manually.

Alert Categorization and Delivery

The bot uses Telegram messages in a private chat to deliver the alerts to the user. To keep the alerts organized and non-overwhelming, they are categorized into threads. The main categories envisaged (which can be adjusted as needed) include:
	•	Urgent: High-priority alerts that likely require immediate attention. For example, a trusted caller posting about a token launch or a significant piece of news (exchange listing, hack in a project, etc.). Also, initial detection of a big pump or spike could fall here.
	•	Possibly Interesting: Medium priority alerts, worth looking at but not necessarily requiring instant action. Perhaps from lesser-known callers or without immediate clear action, or maybe something to note (like someone mentioning a token that could be researched later).
	•	Overview/Summary: Low-priority updates, typically generated by the AI summarization or periodic reports. This might include a summary of what happened in a chat over the last few hours, or a list of tokens that were mentioned that day with their performance, etc. It’s more for keeping an eye on trends rather than immediate action.
	•	Misc/Other: There could be other threads or categories if needed (e.g., a thread for all spike notifications if you separate those, or a thread for alerts that are just FYI). The categories should be reflected by actual threads in the Telegram output chat.

Telegram Output Mechanism: The output is implemented as a private group or channel that the user and bot have access to. For threading, a Telegram forum group (where topics are enabled) is suitable. The developer can create a private group, enable topics, create the topics named “Urgent”, “Interesting”, etc., and note their topic IDs. The bot is added to this group (as it’s a user, possibly the user themselves will just see it posting as them or as the same account – actually, if the bot runs on the same user account, it might be effectively the user posting to themselves. An alternative is to use a second bot account just for output, but assuming single account for simplicity: the user could create a channel and add the userbot as admin to post).

In practice, using the user account to send messages to oneself:
	•	The bot could use the “Saved Messages” chat as output (that’s the user’s private cloud notes). However, Saved Messages has no threading and might get cluttered.
	•	Better is to use a private channel or group. For example, the user can create a private channel named “Crypto Alerts” and the bot account (user account itself or a bot token) posts there. Channels don’t support threads yet, but groups with topics do.
	•	If using a group with topics (threads), the user must not mind having their user account talk to itself. Actually, since it’s the same account, Telethon can still send messages as the user in a group where the user is the only member. This might appear as the user talking. It might be cleaner to use a separate bot for output to avoid confusion. But since the requirement is user account, we can for now assume the user account will also output (essentially it’s like self-messaging in a group, which Telegram allows).

Thread Posting: As described earlier, to post into a specific thread, the bot will use the reply_to parameter with the topic’s first message (or topic ID). This requires knowing the topic ID, which can be obtained via Telegram’s interface or API. In code, once we have category_topics = {"Urgent": topic_message_id1, "Interesting": topic_message_id2, ...}, the bot simply does:

await client.send_message(output_chat_id, text=alert_text, reply_to=category_topics[assigned_category])

Where assigned_category is the string category from the analysis pipeline. If the category somehow doesn’t exist or threads aren’t available (misconfiguration), the bot should default to just posting in the main chat or a fallback thread, and log a warning.

Alert content formatting: We want alerts to be easily readable in Telegram’s UI. Some best practices:
	•	Use Markdown or HTML formatting (Telegram allows bots to format messages). Emphasize token symbols, use monospace for contract addresses, maybe bold for important parts. But be careful since as a user account, we might not have the Bot API sendMessage with parse_mode. Telethon as a user can still send formatted text if we manually include markdown symbols (Telegram apps will render basic formatting like **bold** for bold, etc.).
	•	Possibly include emojis to draw attention: e.g. “🚨” for urgent, “📈” for interesting token, etc., as part of the message.
	•	If multiple alerts come in quick succession, each alert in its own thread will separate them visually which is good. The user can then click the “Urgent” topic and see all urgent messages.
	•	The alert might also include a quick action hint, like “Use /ignore token XYZ if you want to stop alerts on this token.” (if such command is implemented for filtering).

Example Alert Message (Urgent thread):
“🚨 [BigPump Group] – CallerAlice (Rating 9.1) mentioned NEWToken!
”{message content snippet}”
Token NEWToken: Price=$0.0045 (+20% 1h), MCAP=$2M, FDV=$10M. Contract 0xabc...1234. Honeypot check: ✅ No issues detected.
( spike in chat activity 🔥 )”

This example shows a format where we identify the source chat, who said it (Alice), what token, the snippet of what they said, then some data about the token, and notes like spike or honeypot. The content can be adjusted as needed.

Rate limiting alerts: If a very active chat has many messages that all qualify as alerts, the bot should avoid flooding the output. Potential strategies:
	•	Combine multiple related alerts into one message if they occur close in time. E.g., if 3 people mention the same token around the same time, one aggregated alert might suffice.
	•	Or, if too many “Interesting” alerts are coming, perhaps promote only the top few or temporarily raise the threshold. The /spikesedit or similar commands might allow the user to adjust this on the fly.
	•	Ensure the Telegram output sending itself is throttled to avoid hitting message per second limits. Telethon can queue sends; a short await asyncio.sleep(1) between sends can be enough if volume is low. For higher volume, one might need to batch into one message (like a summary of multiple alerts in one).

In summary, this delivery mechanism leverages Telegram’s own features (topics, channels) to present the data in a structured way to the user, ensuring that urgent matters grab attention while less critical info is accessible but not overwhelming.

Reputation and Rating System (Callers & Chats)

To improve filtering and prioritization, the bot maintains a rating system for both individual callers (users who post signals) and entire chats. The ratings are numerical scores that can influence how the bot treats messages. These scores are calculated based on formulas that consider various metrics, and importantly, these formulas should be configurable so the user can adjust how ratings work.

Caller Ratings: Each verified caller (and possibly even unverified users who appear frequently) can have a score. This score might represent the caller’s track record or trust level. For example, it could be based on:
	•	The performance of their past calls (did the tokens they called out pump by X% after their call? Did they often warn about scams correctly? etc.).
	•	How often they post and how relevant those posts have been (maybe if they spam often without results, their score lowers).
	•	Manual input: the user might manually set or adjust a caller’s rating if they have personal insight (e.g., trust this person more).

The system might start with some default or initial ratings (e.g., known good callers start at 8/10, unknown at 5/10) and then dynamically adjust. Each time an alert is triggered by a caller’s message, the bot could mark whether that alert turned out to be useful (this might require feedback or could be implied by whether the token pumped – which we could check via price later). Over time, scores adjust.

To implement this, we’ll have a callers table or config that stores at least: user_id, username, rating, and perhaps counters like calls_made, successful_calls etc. A simplistic formula could be rating = successful_calls / total_calls or a more complex weighted formula considering magnitude of success.

Chat Ratings: Similarly, each chat/group can have a score indicating its quality or signal-to-noise ratio. Metrics for chat rating:
	•	Average number of important alerts per day from that chat vs total messages (higher means the chat is efficient).
	•	Perhaps an external quality measure (e.g., number of members, or known to be a premium group).
	•	The presence of high-quality callers in it.
	•	The frequency of scams or false alarms (if many honeypots mentioned, maybe lower rating).

Chat rating can be used in decisions: e.g., if a low-rated chat has a “maybe interesting” message, the bot might not alert it unless it scores very high on other factors, whereas a high-rated chat’s messages might be given benefit of doubt.

Configurability: The user should be able to configure how these ratings are calculated. This could be done via:
	•	Configuration File: e.g., a JSON or YAML file where the formula or weightings are defined. The bot can read this on startup or on command to update how it computes ratings. Possibly using a mini scripting language or just a set of weights.
	•	Commands: e.g., a command /setformula callers <new_formula> or /setrating Bob 9.5 to directly adjust values.

We can provide a sample configuration format. For example, in YAML:

# Rating formulas and weights configuration
rating_formulas:
  caller_score: "0.5 * base_score + 0.5 * (success_rate * 10)"   # example formula
  chat_score: "messages_per_day > 100 ? 0.8*important_rate + 0.2*members/1000 : important_rate"
# Explanation:
# - base_score could be an initial manual rating
# - success_rate is ratio of successful calls
# - important_rate is ratio of messages that became alerts
# - members is number of members in chat
# - (The formula syntax could be Python eval or similar, carefully sandboxed)
  
# Example caller list with initial ratings
verified_callers:
  - username: "CallerAlice"
    user_id: 123456789
    initial_rating: 8.0
  - username: "CallerBob"
    user_id: 987654321
    initial_rating: 5.0
  
# Thresholds for message scoring
thresholds:
  urgent_score: 0.9
  interesting_score: 0.5
  spike_messages: 15        # spike if >15 messages in 5 min (default)
  spike_multiplier: 3.0     # or spike if >3x average rate

The above is a pseudo-config illustrating possible entries. The bot would parse such config and apply it. If using formulas, the implementation needs to be careful (e.g., use a safe eval or a small expression parser to compute the formula). Alternatively, simpler approach: define the formula in code with some configurable weights (like weight_success_rate = 0.5, etc., rather than full free-form formula, for safety).

Using Ratings in Message Analysis: When the pipeline runs:
	•	If the sender is in verified_callers, retrieve their rating. This can directly influence the importance score (e.g., multiply base importance by (1 + caller_rating/10) or add some portion of it).
	•	If a chat’s rating is low, perhaps down-weight the importance unless other factors are high. Conversely, if a chat rating is high, up-weight a bit. This ensures high quality chats get more attention even for subtle signals.

Rating Updates: Over time, the bot can update ratings:
	•	Caller rating update: e.g., if a token mentioned by a caller pumps significantly after their call, increment their success count. Possibly, track performance: the bot could retrospectively check the price change of tokens after X hours of being called. This is complex but doable with the price data it fetches. A simpler metric: if an “Urgent” alert from that caller was sent, consider that a positive outcome and tweak rating up slightly. If an alert was false (like nothing happened or it was a scam), adjust down.
	•	Chat rating update: maybe daily or weekly, evaluate how many alerts came from each chat vs noise. If a chat yielded no alerts in a week, maybe its rating goes down (or stays low). If it consistently produces good alerts, raise it.

These updates can be done in background tasks or triggered by certain events (like a scheduled job that evaluates last day’s alerts).

Caller and Chat Ranking Commands: The user might want to query these. The command /callers 30 mentioned likely means “show top callers from the past 30 days” or similar. The bot would then fetch data from its records:
	•	Possibly it has stored each call event with outcome, so it can compute who had the most successful calls in last 30 days.
	•	It then responds in the private chat (maybe in the Overview thread or just as a reply) with a ranked list: e.g.,
	1.	CallerAlice – Score 9.1 – 5 successful calls (10 calls total)
	2.	CallerBob – Score 7.5 – 3 successful out of 4 calls
	3.	… etc.

Or /callers could simply list current ratings of all known callers.

Another command might be /chats to list chat rankings similarly.

The command /spikesedit sounds like editing spike settings. Possibly the user can send /spikesedit 20 5min to change threshold to 20 messages/5min. The bot should parse that and update its config (and maybe persist it).

Implementing command handling is straightforward with Telethon as shown before – looking for messages in the private chat that start with /. Since it’s a user account, these are not “commands” in the Bot API sense, but the user can still type them and the bot can catch them. We should ensure the bot only responds to the authorized user (avoid someone else in that chat issuing commands – though it might be single-user chat anyway).

AI-Assisted Delayed Analysis (Batch Processing)

One innovative feature of this architecture is the use of AI not only in real-time scoring, but also in deferred batch analysis. The idea is that some messages or patterns might be better analyzed in aggregate or with more time/context, rather than instantly. The bot will periodically gather such items and process them with AI to improve overall insight. This is implemented as follows:
	•	Flagging for Review: During the real-time pipeline, certain messages that are not alerted might be marked for “AI review”. For example:
	•	Messages that had a moderate importance score (just below the threshold) or were ambiguous.
	•	Situations where there was a spike but it wasn’t clear which message in the spike was the cause.
	•	Any message containing complex info (like a long post or analysis by a user) that the simple rules didn’t fully understand.
	•	Possibly, if multiple chats discuss the same token, instead of alerting on each mention, the bot could consolidate that via AI later (like “Token XYZ was mentioned in 3 chats today. Combined sentiment: mostly positive.”).
The bot can add these message IDs to a “pending analysis” list or database table.
	•	Periodic Batch Job: Every 4-6 hours (the exact interval can be configured; perhaps 4 hours during active times, maybe 6 overnight), a scheduled task runs. This can be done via asyncio.loop.call_later, APScheduler, or a simple loop with sleep in an asyncio.create_task if the bot runs continuously. The batch job will:
	•	Retrieve all messages flagged for AI review that haven’t been processed yet in this manner.
	•	Organize them by context if needed (for example, group messages by chat or by topic).
	•	Formulate a prompt for the AI. For instance, the bot might take a group of 5-10 messages from a spike and ask the AI: “Summarize what happened in Chat X in the last hour, given these messages.” Or for a set of token mentions: “Several mentions of token XYZ occurred in different chats. What is being said about it and does it seem important?”
	•	The AI (which could be an external API like GPT-4, or a local model) returns a summary or analysis. The bot then interprets the result.
	•	AI Results Utilization: Depending on the AI’s output:
	•	If it’s a summary of a spike or chat activity, the bot will post that summary to the Overview thread. For example: “Summary (Chat CryptoAlerts): In the last 4 hours, the chat discussed token XYZ extensively. The token was hyped due to an upcoming exchange listing, and members speculated a 50% price increase. Some skepticism was noted about liquidity. [AI-generated summary]”. This provides the user with a useful recap.
	•	If the AI identified something that was missed as important, the bot could either post a late alert or at least flag it. For example, the AI might conclude “User Bob’s message was actually a subtle announcement of a new project launch.” The bot could then treat that as a late-arriving “Interesting” alert (maybe marked as [AI identified] in the message).
	•	AI might also help classify things like sentiment (was the chat excited or fearful about the token?) which can be additional info.
	•	Feedback Loop: The results from AI can also feed back into the system:
	•	Update caller/chat ratings if the AI discovered a caller made a significant comment that was initially ignored.
	•	Adjust the importance scoring thresholds or algorithm if AI consistently finds certain patterns important (this could be more advanced where the system learns over time, but at minimum, the developer/user can manually adjust based on AI findings).
	•	Resource Management: Since calling an AI (especially an external one) is resource-intensive, the bot should limit how much it sends. Batching multiple messages into one prompt for summarization is more efficient than one prompt per message. Also, the frequency of every 4-6 hours is a balance between getting timely analysis and not overloading the AI API. The exact interval and number of messages per batch can be configured.
	•	Error Handling: If the AI service is down or responds with an error, the bot should handle it gracefully — perhaps retry after some time or skip that batch and log the error. If using an external API, handle rate limits and cost considerations (maybe skip analysis if too many messages to avoid huge payloads).

This delayed AI analysis feature essentially serves as a safety net: it catches things the real-time filter might miss and provides summary insights, ensuring the user stays informed without having to read through all chat messages themselves. It uses the AI’s strength in understanding context and summarizing, complementing the real-time deterministic rules.

Data Storage and Database Design

A robust database design is essential for this bot to maintain state, calculate trends (like spikes and ratings), and support multi-user expansion. We can use a relational SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL for reliability and complex queries) or a combination with a NoSQL store for flexibility. Here we outline a SQL schema for clarity, along with what each table stores:

1. Messages Table: Stores information about messages that have been processed.
	•	It will record basic message info and the analysis outcome (so we don’t re-process or for auditing).
	•	Key fields: message_id (unique per chat, combined with chat_id as primary key, or a separate internal id), chat_id, sender_id, timestamp, text (or a truncated version if storage is a concern), flags like is_spike (boolean), tokens (maybe a JSON array of token symbols/addresses found), caller_id (if sender was a verified caller), importance_score (the numeric score computed), category (what category was assigned, if any), and perhaps alert_id (reference to an Alerts table if we store alerts separately).
	•	We might also store processed=True/False to mark if fully processed or if pending AI analysis, etc.

Example schema (simplified):

CREATE TABLE messages (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,         -- internal ID
    chat_id BIGINT,
    message_id BIGINT,
    sender_id BIGINT,
    text TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ,
    is_spike BOOLEAN,
    tokens TEXT[],                 -- e.g., array of token symbols detected
    caller_id BIGINT,              -- if sender is a known caller, else NULL
    importance_score REAL,
    category VARCHAR(20),          -- e.g., 'Urgent', 'Interesting', 'None'
    alerted BOOLEAN,               -- whether an alert was sent for this message
    needs_ai BOOLEAN               -- whether flagged for AI re-analysis
);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_chat_time ON messages(chat_id, timestamp);

The index helps queries per chat by time (useful for spike calculation queries or cleanup). We use an array for tokens for simplicity (Postgres supports array or JSON). Alternatively, a separate table for tokens mentioned could link message_id to token for more normalization.

2. Events/Alerts Table: We might have a table for notable events or alerts sent:
	•	This could log each alert that was actually sent to the user, with reference to the message(s) that caused it, the category, time sent, etc.
	•	Could also log spike events (when a spike threshold was crossed, even if no specific message triggered an alert, we could have an event record).
	•	This helps in creating an overview or history of alerts, and for calculating how often alerts happen (maybe to tune thresholds or to show stats).

Example:

CREATE TABLE alerts (
    alert_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    time_sent TIMESTAMPTZ,
    category VARCHAR(20),
    chat_id BIGINT,
    message_id BIGINT,      -- reference to the main message that triggered it
    summary TEXT            -- the text of the alert (could be the same as sent message)
);

And possibly a separate event type for spike: or include a event_type field to distinguish “alert” vs “spike summary” vs “daily summary”.

3. Callers Table: Stores info about known (and maybe unknown) callers.
	•	Fields: user_id (primary key, since each user is unique), username, current_rating, and maybe stats like number_of_calls, successful_calls, total_messages, etc., and last_updated.
	•	Possibly a notes or tags field if we want to mark something special (like “this caller is from VIP group” or so).
	•	If we track performance, we may also have another table for individual calls (a join of caller, token, time, outcome) – but that might be overkill for now. Instead, can derive from messages + alerts if needed.

Example:

CREATE TABLE callers (
    user_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT,
    rating REAL,
    calls_made INT,
    calls_success INT,
    last_active TIMESTAMPTZ
);

The calls_made and calls_success can be updated as we detect calls and later measure outcomes. rating is what the system uses; could be recomputed or directly updated.

4. Chats Table: Stores info about monitored chats.
	•	Fields: chat_id (PK), chat_name, chat_rating, messages_per_day (maybe moving average), alerts_per_day, last_spike (timestamp of last detected spike), etc.
	•	This table helps quickly looking up a chat’s rating or other metadata without recalculating on the fly.
	•	Also could include a flag like enabled (in case we temporarily disable a chat from monitoring via a command).

Example:

CREATE TABLE chats (
    chat_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    rating REAL,
    avg_msg_per_min REAL,
    last_spike TIMESTAMPTZ,
    alerts_today INT
);

Where avg_msg_per_min is updated periodically or over a rolling window to detect spikes (can be used along with thresholds).

5. User Config Table: In a multi-user future or even single-user with multiple config items, a table for configuration.
	•	For now, if it’s just one user, config might also be loaded from file or environment. But having it in DB allows runtime changes via commands to persist.
	•	Fields could be user_id (to support multi-user), key (like ‘spike_threshold’), value (as text, which can be parsed to int/float/whatever). Alternatively, columns for each config item but that’s less flexible.
	•	Also can store preferences like which networks are enabled, which categories the user wants to receive, etc.

Example:

CREATE TABLE user_config (
    user_id BIGINT,
    config_key TEXT,
    config_value TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY(user_id, config_key)
);

We might store numbers as text and cast when reading, to keep it simple. If we only have one user, user_id could be omitted and just have one row or use a singleton pattern.

6. Token Cache Table (optional): If we want to persist token info.
	•	Not strictly necessary to store token data in DB if we can fetch from API, but caching can improve performance and allow historical analysis.
	•	A tokens table could store last known price, marketcap, last updated time, etc., for each token (identified by contract or symbol).
	•	This can also help ensure we don’t call APIs too often for the same token. The bot can query this table first to see if data is recent enough.

Example:

CREATE TABLE tokens (
    token_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,   -- could be contract address or "ETH:0xABC..." to namespace
    symbol TEXT,
    name TEXT,
    last_price REAL,
    last_mcap REAL,
    last_updated TIMESTAMPTZ,
    chain TEXT                  -- 'Ethereum' or 'Base' etc.
);

Indexes & Performance: We will want indexes on message timestamps (for spike queries and chronology), on sender_id in messages (if we want to quickly fetch all messages by a certain caller, e.g., to evaluate their success rate), and on anything that we frequently search by (maybe token in messages if doing a lot of token-specific analysis). For large scale, partitioning the messages table by date could help (if millions of messages, archive old ones).

Retention: Depending on volume, the DB could grow. If the chats are very active, storing every message might become large. We might not need to store all messages indefinitely. Options:
	•	Only store messages that were alerts or flagged (so we don’t save trivial messages). That loses some context though.
	•	Or store all for a while but prune after X days those that were never alerted and not used by AI. The user likely doesn’t need historical data beyond a certain point for non-important messages.
	•	Keep summary stats instead of raw messages for older data.

The database design above supports the current needs and is extensible. If moving to multi-user, most tables would include a user_id field (or even be schema-separated per user depending on approach). For example, messages could have a user_id to denote which user’s instance saw that message (if one service monitors multiple accounts). Alternatively, for multi-user the architecture might shift to a model where one central service monitors various chats (some public maybe) and then multiple users subscribe to certain alerts.

Logging and Monitoring Mechanism

Logging is crucial for debugging the bot’s operation and monitoring its health, especially since it interacts with external systems and runs continuously. The logging mechanism will include:
	•	Structured Logging: Use a logging library (like Python’s built-in logging module) configured to output timestamped logs. Each log entry should include context such as the chat or token involved, and the severity level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG). Example log lines:
	•	INFO 2025-08-12 10:00:00 [Listener] Message received in Chat123 (ID -100123...): length=200 chars
	•	DEBUG 2025-08-12 10:00:00 [Analysis] Tokens found: [XYZ], Caller: CallerAlice (ID 12345), Spike: True, Score: 0.88
	•	INFO 2025-08-12 10:00:00 [Alert] Sent Urgent alert for message 999 in Chat123 to thread 'Urgent'
	•	WARNING 2025-08-12 10:05:00 [API] CoinGecko API timeout for token XYZ
	•	ERROR 2025-08-12 10:06:00 [AI] OpenAI API exception: Rate limit exceeded
These logs help trace what the bot is doing and diagnose issues (like missed messages or API failures).
	•	Error Handling and Alerts: If a serious error occurs (exception not caught in processing, or the Telegram connection drops), the bot should log it and possibly send a notification. Since this is a personal bot, it could even send a message to the user in the private chat on certain critical failures (e.g., “Bot has disconnected from Telegram, attempting to reconnect…” or “Error: API key invalid, please check config.”). This way the user is aware of issues quickly.
	•	Monitoring Tools: For a production or long-running deployment, one might integrate with external monitoring:
	•	Use a process manager (like systemd or Docker with restart policy) to ensure the bot restarts if it crashes.
	•	Possibly integrate with a service like Sentry for error tracking, or simple email alerts for unhandled exceptions.
	•	If multiple bots or multi-user, a dashboard showing stats (messages processed per hour, alerts sent, etc.) could be useful. This can be as simple as a periodic log summary or a small web interface pulling from the database.
	•	Log Rotation: Over time, logs can grow large. Implementing log rotation (e.g., daily logs or size-based rotation keeping last N files) prevents running out of disk or memory if logging to a file. Python’s logging RotatingFileHandler can do this easily.
	•	Verbose Levels: Possibly allow adjusting logging verbosity via a command or config (for example, turn on DEBUG for a specific chat if troubleshooting why something wasn’t flagged, then turn it off normally to reduce noise).

Overall, the logging mechanism ensures transparency in the bot’s operations which is especially important given the complexity (AI decisions, external data) – it helps the developer or user trust what the bot is doing and verify its decisions.

Configuration and Customization

Flexibility is key since the crypto space is dynamic and user preferences vary. The bot should allow configuration through both static files and runtime commands:

Configuration Files: A config file (YAML or JSON) loaded on startup can contain:
	•	API keys and secrets (Telegram API, crypto data APIs, AI API keys, etc.) – these might also be environment variables for security.
	•	List of target chats to monitor (chat IDs/usernames).
	•	Category definitions (names of categories and their thresholds or topic IDs for output).
	•	Initial lists of verified callers and their ratings.
	•	Default threshold values (spike thresholds, scoring weights, etc.).
	•	Flags for enabling/disabling certain features (e.g., enable_ai_analysis: true/false if the user can choose to turn off the AI part, or enable_honeypot_check).
	•	Multi-user settings (if applicable later, like a list of user accounts or a mapping of which chats belong to which user, etc.).

Example snippet of a YAML config:

telegram:
  api_id: 123456
  api_hash: "abcdef123456..."
  session_name: "crypto_userbot"
  output_chat: -100987654321  # ID of the private alert group/channel
  category_topics:
    Urgent: 1001    # these would be the topic/thread IDs or first message IDs
    Interesting: 1002
    Overview: 1003

analysis:
  spike_threshold: 20            # 20 messages per 5min triggers spike
  spike_time_window: "5m"
  spike_sensitivity: "dynamic"   # or "fixed"
  token_watchlist: ["ETH", "USDT", "BTC"]  # example to always ignore or always watch
  min_market_cap: 1000000        # ignore tokens with mcap below $1M? (just an example)
  use_ai_realtime: false         # whether to call AI for every message or only batch
  ai_review_interval: "4h"

ratings:
  default_caller_rating: 5.0
  rating_formula_caller: "0.7*prev_rating + 0.3*(success_rate*10)"
  rating_formula_chat: "0.5*prev_rating + 0.5*(alert_rate*10)"
  # (In practice, formulas might be simpler or code-defined, but here to illustrate configurability)

callers:
  - username: "CallerAlice"
    user_id: 111111111
    rating: 8.0
  - username: "CallerBob"
    user_id: 222222222
    rating: 7.0

# ... etc

Commands for Runtime Changes:
	•	The bot should parse special commands from the user in the private chat. We already touched on /callers 30 and /spikesedit. Additional possibilities:
	•	/help to list available commands and a brief usage.
	•	/listcallers or /callers to list current caller ratings.
	•	/addcaller <user> <rating> to add a new verified caller on the fly (the bot might resolve <user> which could be a username or a reply to a message by that user).
	•	/setrating <user> <rating> to adjust someone’s rating.
	•	/editchat <chat> <rating> similarly for chat rating or to toggle monitoring a chat.
	•	/spikesedit <threshold> to change the spike message threshold.
	•	/togglenetwork <chain> to enable/disable alerts for a certain chain (maybe the user isn’t interested in Base, etc.).
	•	/aiinterval 6h to change AI analysis frequency, etc.
	•	/pause and /resume to temporarily stop or start processing (if the user needs quiet time).

Implementing these would involve the bot detecting messages starting with / in the output chat, parsing the arguments, updating the in-memory config or database accordingly, and replying with a confirmation. Also, after updating config, some changes may require writing to the config file or DB to persist, or immediate effect on variables used in analysis.

Security for Commands: Since this is a private setup, likely only the owner uses it. If multi-user, we would have to authenticate commands per user (like each user’s commands only affect their scope). In the single-user case, just ensure nobody else is in that chat. If a friend is invited, then the bot should check that the sender of a command is the authorized user ID.

Configuration of AI: The user might want to configure aspects of AI usage, such as:
	•	Which model or API to use (maybe a local model vs OpenAI, etc.).
	•	The prompts or style (some advanced usage might allow customizing the prompt templates).
	•	The criteria for sending something to AI (like min_score_for_ai = 0.4 etc.).

These could also be in config or left to code defaults unless the user specifically needs to tweak.

Hot-reload: If possible, allow reloading config without restarting the bot. For example, a /reload command that re-reads the config file. Or each command as it updates values in memory, also saves them.

By providing both a config file for initial setup and runtime commands for tweaks, the user gets convenience and control. They could start the bot with a general config, and then adjust thresholds as they observe the alerts to reduce noise or increase sensitivity.

Future Expansion: Multi-User and Subscription Support

While the current design is for a single user (the owner’s account monitoring chats they are in), there’s interest in making this system support multiple users, possibly as a subscription service. Planning for this early ensures easier scaling later.

Multi-User Architecture Considerations:
	•	Each user would ideally have their own set of target chats to monitor (which implies the service needs access to those chats). There are a couple of approaches:
	1.	User-Account Per User: Each user provides their Telegram credentials (phone number/API auth) so the system can run a Telegram client on their behalf (like a userbot for each user). This can be resource-intensive as each user might require a separate connection (Telethon can manage multiple sessions though). Also, storing user credentials is sensitive. But this way, the system can read any chat the user is in, exactly as the single-user case.
	2.	Bot Account + Added to Chats: Alternatively, the service could use a single (or a few) bot accounts and have users invite that bot to the groups they want monitored. Then one central Telegram bot is in multiple groups across different users. However, many crypto groups might not allow unknown bots, and this also means the bot can be aware of multiple users’ contexts simultaneously, which complicates filtering (ensuring user A doesn’t get alerts about user B’s groups).
The user-account-per-user model aligns more with privacy and existing structure, but would require horizontally scaling (multiple processes or threads for each user’s connection to avoid one failure affecting all, etc.).
	•	Data Partitioning: Each user’s data (messages, alerts, configs) must be isolated. In the database, add a user_id or account_id column to relevant tables. Or use separate schemas/databases per user. The choice might depend on scale. A single database with user_id in each table is manageable if there aren’t too many users, and queries always filter by user_id. For example, messages table primary key might become (user_id, chat_id, message_id) combined.
	•	User Configuration: Each user would have their own config (which chats, thresholds, etc.). Possibly an interface (like a Telegram command or a web UI) for them to set these up. One could allow an onboarding: the user starts the bot (perhaps via an actual Telegram Bot for interface), provides their phone to authenticate a userbot session, selects which chats to monitor, etc. This is a complex flow but doable.
	•	Subscription Management: If monetizing, each user might have an active/inactive status, perhaps stored in a users table with subscription info (expiry, plan level which might limit number of chats or features). The bot would check this before running or sending alerts. E.g., a free tier might monitor 2 chats with limited AI, whereas premium monitors 10 chats with full AI analysis.
	•	Scaling AI and APIs: With multiple users, the volume of messages to analyze grows. The architecture may need:
	•	A task queue (like Celery or RabbitMQ) to distribute message processing across worker processes/machines, especially for AI calls which are slow. This way, if 10 users’ chats all get busy at once, tasks can run in parallel on separate workers.
	•	Rate limiting or pooling of external API calls: maybe use one API key per user or ensure one user’s heavy usage doesn’t exhaust the API quota for others.
	•	Possibly a microservices approach: one service handles Telegram receiving (for all users or one per user), another service handles heavy analysis and data fetching, communicating via messages or shared DB.
	•	Security & Privacy: Multi-user means the system is handling potentially sensitive data from users’ private chats. Ensuring encryption at rest for database entries, secure transmission (though all within the server in this case), and good isolation is important. And obtaining user consent because essentially the service acts on their behalf in Telegram.
	•	Multi-user Output: Each user would get their own private alert channel or chat. For instance, the system could auto-create a private channel for each user or use the user’s “Saved Messages”. More simply, since each userbot is basically the user, it can send to that user’s own saved messages or create a small group with them. But maybe an official bot could DM them (less likely if we want threads).
Perhaps better: the service could create a private forum group for each user named “Your Crypto Alerts”, with the userbot and the user in it (user is essentially the same identity, so maybe it invites the actual user account? That’s weird since userbot is the user; for multi-user the userbot and actual user are the same identity on Telegram, so scratch that).
Instead, if they use an official bot for interface, that official bot can send them categorized alerts in some form (like separate messages labeled by category, since official bots don’t have topics in DMs).
But if each user runs a userbot as them, they could mirror alerts to their own channel as currently.
	•	Alternate Approach: Another idea for multi-user without each providing credentials: Some crypto chats are public or have bot-friendly clones. The service could have one set of monitors for those and then users subscribe to tokens or callers they care about. However, since the prompt says user is in needed chats, likely they are private or premium groups, so not publicly accessible.

Given the complexity, the architecture should remain modular: one instance per user is easiest to conceptualize (each running our described system separately). For a SaaS, orchestrating those instances and providing an onboarding UI would be needed.

For now, planning for expansion means writing code that doesn’t hardcode a single user’s IDs everywhere, using config or DB to drive that, and ensuring everything references user-specific data.

Questions for the AI

Finally, here are some open questions or areas where an AI’s insight might be sought to further refine the system:
	1.	Improving Accuracy: What additional signals or analysis techniques could be employed to improve the accuracy of identifying truly important messages while filtering out noise? (For example, could sentiment analysis or social network analysis of message interactions help?)
	2.	Scalability Concerns: Given this architecture, what potential bottlenecks or points of failure might arise when scaling to many chats or users, and how might we mitigate them?
	3.	User Experience: How can the bot better present information to avoid overwhelming the user? Are there alternative ways of categorizing or summarizing alerts that would be more user-friendly (perhaps interactive or with adjustable levels of detail)?
	4.	AI Ethics & Accuracy: How can we ensure that the AI summarizations or importance judgments are reliable and do not hallucinate false information about tokens or events? What measures could be added to verify AI outputs before acting on them?
	5.	Security & Privacy: What are the security implications of using a user’s Telegram account for this service, and what best practices should be followed to protect the user’s data and account (e.g., handling of credentials, avoiding detection by Telegram if they discourage userbots)?

These questions could guide further development or be posed to an AI to generate ideas for enhancing the architecture.

Self-Review (Role-Based Critique)
	•	Senior Backend Developer: The architecture is comprehensive, but implementing it will require careful attention to performance and concurrency. Using an async library like Telethon is good; however, processing each message (especially with external API calls and AI requests) could become slow. I would consider using background worker threads or tasks for things like API calls so as not to block the Telegram event loop. Also, robust error handling needs to be in place – for example, if an API call fails, it shouldn’t crash the whole message handler. The code snippets and modular design look maintainable. One concern is the complexity of state (tracking spikes, etc.) – we should ensure to encapsulate that logic, maybe with helper classes (e.g., a SpikeDetector class managing counts per chat). Caching and rate limiting will be important to prevent hitting external service limits. Overall, the design is sound, but I’d prepare extensive unit tests for each sub-component (parsers, scorers) to ensure they work in isolation.
	•	System Architect: The system is well thought out with clear separation of concerns (ingestion, processing, external integration, output). Scaling vertically (one user) it’s fine. For horizontal scaling (multi-user), the document rightly notes using separate processes or threads per user might be needed. We might consider a message queue system where incoming messages are published to a queue, and a pool of worker processes consume them to do analysis, which would make scaling to multiple CPU cores or machines easier. Also, if the userbase grows, we should consider how to distribute the load of Telegram connections – perhaps sharding by user across multiple instances. The architecture should also consider Telegram-specific failure modes: e.g., how to reconnect on connection drop (Telethon handles some of this internally, but we may need a watchdog). The use of a relational database is appropriate, but we should also think about using Redis for quick in-memory counters (like message counts for spike detection) for speed, then flush to DB periodically. Security and privacy as mentioned are crucial; architecturally, isolating each user’s data and perhaps containerizing user-specific processes could add security.
	•	Quality Assurance (QA): From a QA perspective, there are many components to test:
	•	Unit tests: for message parsing (ensure token regex picks up addresses, ensure the scoring algorithm behaves as expected for various combinations of inputs), for the rating adjustments, etc.
	•	Integration tests: maybe simulate Telegram messages (Telethon allows testing by sending events). We should test scenarios like a spike happening – does the bot correctly identify and only alert once per spike? If multiple token mentions, does it gather data correctly?
	•	AI component: That’s harder to test deterministically, but we can at least test the plumbing (e.g., given a dummy AI function that returns a known output, does the bot handle it and post summary). Also test fallback if AI is off or fails.
	•	Performance tests: simulate a burst of 100 messages arriving within a minute and see if the system keeps up without dropping messages or backlog. The spike detection and logging might need tuning under heavy load.
	•	Edge cases: extremely long messages, or messages with weird characters, multiple contract addresses in one message, etc. Also what if the token API returns an unexpected format or missing data. We should also test the command interface – e.g., what if the user types an unknown command or wrong format, the bot should handle it gracefully (not crash, maybe reply with usage help).
	•	Telegram quirks: ensure that posting to threads works as intended (maybe test on a sample group). Also test what happens if the output chat or topics are not correctly set – does the bot warn the user?
	•	Multi-user scenario (if implemented): test that one user’s commands or data don’t leak to another.
QA would also involve testing on a real Telegram environment (maybe with test groups) to verify end-to-end that an intended trigger actually produces the correct alert message formatting.
	•	Product Manager: This solution hits all the points the user wanted and then some. The bot categorizes information which is great for usability, as traders can focus on “Urgent” things first. The use of AI for summaries means the user won’t miss the forest for the trees – they’ll get periodic insights even if they didn’t act on each alert. The feature set is quite rich. I’d consider if the user might want a mobile-friendly digest or maybe an email summary as well, but since this is Telegram-centric, probably not needed yet. One thing to prioritize is making configuration user-friendly – not everyone will want to edit YAML or remember complex commands, so perhaps provide sane defaults and maybe a simple menu via commands for common settings (like a guided setup). The future subscription model is appealing – it could be a unique service for crypto enthusiasts. We’d want to ensure reliability and trust, because users are effectively trusting the bot to filter important info – if it misses something big or false-alarms too much, they’ll lose confidence. So from a product standpoint, fine-tuning the algorithms (maybe starting with a beta period with the user providing feedback on which alerts were useful) will be important. The self-review mechanism here is good; as a PM I’d also ensure we are compliant with Telegram’s terms (userbots can be grey area) to avoid service disruption.
	•	UX Designer: Although this is a backend-heavy product, the user experience hinges on how information is presented in Telegram. Using threads for categories is a clever way to organize alerts. We should make sure the naming of threads is clear and maybe use emoji or color (Telegram topics can have an icon) to help the user spot urgent vs non-urgent quickly. The formatting of messages should be clean – maybe use line breaks and bullet points if sending a lot of info in one alert to avoid a wall of text. For example, token statistics could be formatted in a list. Also, consider the volume of notifications: if the user has notifications on for that alert chat, an urgent alert should notify immediately, but if too many interesting alerts come, it might annoy them. Maybe advise them to mute the less important threads and only have Urgent ping. If Telegram supports it, perhaps the bot can even mention the user for urgent ones to override mute (though if it’s same user account, can’t mention self – if we had a separate bot identity it could). The commands UX might be improved by adding simple shortcuts – e.g., the bot could offer buttons (Telegram bots can have custom buttons, but userbot cannot easily – unless we integrate a real bot for control). Perhaps an alternative is the bot could respond to certain keywords not just slash commands, for a more conversational feel. Since the user is technical (they have this custom bot), this is less of an issue. Overall, the UX in Telegram should be tested to ensure the threads approach is intuitive. If the user hasn’t used threads before, we might include a one-time message explaining how to use them (like “You’ll find alerts organized under Topics above”).
	•	Database Developer: The proposed database schema covers the necessary aspects. I would refine a few things:
	•	Make sure to use proper data types (e.g., BIGINT for Telegram IDs is good, they can be large; REAL for floating can be okay for ratings but maybe DECIMAL for precise values like price).
	•	We might want a compound primary key on messages (chat_id, message_id) because Telegram message IDs are only unique per chat. Using a serial id is fine for internal referencing, but ensuring uniqueness by chat_id+message_id is good to avoid duplicates if the bot restarts and reprocesses history.
	•	For performance, indexing by sender_id on messages will help with caller analysis queries. Index on needs_ai could help when pulling pending AI tasks quickly.
	•	If this grows, partitioning the messages table by date or chat_id could help. Also, cleaning old data as mentioned will keep it manageable.
	•	The use of arrays for tokens is convenient; however, for querying (like “give me all messages that mentioned token X”), a join table would be more normalized. Perhaps it’s fine since most queries are by message->tokens not tokens->messages. We could also use a JSONB to store a dict of token:info in each message row for flexibility (but then queries on it become harder).
	•	The design should also consider transactions and concurrency – e.g., updating counters or ratings might need transactions to avoid race conditions if multiple events update the same caller rating at once. Postgres can handle this with FOR UPDATE selects or simply doing calculation in application with careful locking. Alternatively, if using an ORM like SQLAlchemy, we can use unit-of-work patterns.
	•	One missing piece: if we allow multi-user, we should add user_id to most tables as noted. The user_config table is fine for key-value pairs but maybe have a separate table for thresholds and formulas to allow more structured constraints. But key-value is flexible and quick.
	•	Ensure that any personal data (maybe not much beyond Telegram IDs and message text) is protected if needed. If this becomes commercial, GDPR or other privacy concerns might come in if storing user message content – although the user is technically storing their own messages via this service.
In summary, the DB design is a solid starting point; it covers the needed relations. Proper indexing and careful query design (like for computing stats) will be needed as data grows.
